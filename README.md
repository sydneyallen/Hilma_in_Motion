# Hilma_in_Motion
Hilma in Motion is a generative art project that translates Hilma af Klint’s layered, symbolic forms into motion through code. Built using Processing (Python mode), the prototype animates rotating and resizing arcs recreating piece 165 from Hilma’s SUW series. The project explores the intersection of art and computation, transforming static composition into dynamic movement while experimenting with RGB colour data, loops, and transformations.
